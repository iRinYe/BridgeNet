# BridgeNet: A High-Efficiency Framework Integrating Sequence and Structure for Protein and Enzyme Function Prediction

Welcome to the official repository of **BridgeNet**, a novel pre-trained model designed to integrate protein sequence and structural information for accurate and biologically meaningful protein representation learning. BridgeNet provides a robust and scalable framework for tackling diverse protein property prediction tasks, such as enzyme function classification, coenzyme specificity prediction, and peptide toxicity prediction.

## Overview

Proteins play critical roles in biological systems, and understanding their properties is essential for advancements in fields like biotechnology, synthetic biology, and drug discovery. Computational methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning, have revolutionized protein characterization. However, existing approaches often rely solely on sequence or structure information, limiting their predictive capabilities.

**BridgeNet** overcomes this limitation by integrating sequence and structure representations during pretraining. This novel design enables the model to capture the complementary strengths of both data modalities, resulting in state-of-the-art performance across multiple protein-related tasks. 

### Key Features

- **Integration of Sequence and Structure**: Combines the strengths of sequence-based and structure-based models for comprehensive protein characterization.
- **Pretrained and Fine-Tunable**: Allows for fine-tuning on multiple downstream tasks, including enzyme classification and toxicity prediction.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed to address large-scale protein datasets with a focus on both accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Biologically Meaningful Representations**: Embeds environmental factors and protein dynamics into the learned representations for enhanced interpretability.
